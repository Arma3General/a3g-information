# Welcome to the /a3g/ information repository!
Here you can find some information on how to install the modpack and how to Arma in general. All you need is in the wiki which you can find by clicking the book icon on the right side.

## Who we are
If stumbled upon this site by accident, we are an Arma 3 group from 4chan. You can find our Steam group here: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/a3g. We get together twice a day; at 7pm GMT everyday for European ops and at 6pm PST/ 9pm EST for American ops - everyone is welcome to join. For more information visit the steamgroup and check the wiki of this repository.
